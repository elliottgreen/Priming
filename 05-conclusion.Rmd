# Take Action

_"An idea not coupled with action will never get any bigger than the brain cell
it occupied"_ 
- Arnold Glasow

The implication of Arnolds quip is that action __must__ acompany the knowledge of these three simple yet powerful points of focus.
Thus, it is incumbant upon the leadership of any team to take effective
action. Such 
action may take the form of seeking guidence and mentorship. Or it may be identifying a
resource or team that has a proven record of success in the arena you are about
to enter.

This is where the experience and expertise of a proven team can help provide
an initial push in the right direction. Services like a Gap Analysis or an
Inventory Overview are crucial ensure there are no stones left unturned.
