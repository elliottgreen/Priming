# Three Steps to Achieving an Enterprise Certification
Certification/Authorization is one of the primary ways that an entity can
demonstrate mastery of a subject. It allows two parties to objectively ensure
that an agreed upon minimum standard has been met. Certification also allows a standardized method for testing of said mastery. 
A certification can also foster a continued relationship between entities. 
Given that most certifications are an inherently public endeavour, the
success of the relationship can raise the perceived value of both parties.

__The three steps to ensure that an entity is ready to attempt a
