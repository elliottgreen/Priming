# Atomic Mapping 

Once the requisite standards set by the certifying body are understood, the
next step is to ensure maximum situational awareness of the entity seeking
certification. 

In the case of FedRAMP, the provider of a SaaS Information System (IS) must be
fully aware and able to describe __every__ attribute of that IS. Some such
attributes which must be attested to in documentation are:

* Security Technologies in use
  + Transport Layer Security
  + Secure Sockets Layer
* Encryption Methods
  + Full Disk Encryption
  + Tunneling Protocols
  + Virtual Private Networks
* System Interconnections
  + Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  + Security information and event management (SIEM)


While this is not an exhaustive list, the depth and breadth of the knowledge
required to attest to those few lines is extensive.
