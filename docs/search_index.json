[["index.html", "Cybersecurity Analyst Chapter 1 3 Steps to Achieving an Enterprise Certification", " Cybersecurity Analyst Omar Elliottgreen 2021-08-02 Chapter 1 3 Steps to Achieving an Enterprise Certification Certification/Authorization is one of the primary ways that an entity can demonstrate mastery of a subject. It allows two parties to objectively ensure that an agreed upon minimum standard has been met. Certification also allows a standardized method of testing for said mastery. A certification can also foster a continued relationship between entities. Given that most certifications are an inherently public endeavour, the success of the relationship can raise the perceived value of both parties. "],["understand-the-objective.html", "Chapter 2 Understand the Objective", " Chapter 2 Understand the Objective The first step in an effort to achieve any certification is to identify and understand the standards set forth by the certifying body. That is to say, the certification itself is a result of achieving the standards. That achievement is verified by a neutral third party with testing and review. Thus, in order to be successful, it is paramount to understand what is required and how it will be verified. To illustrate the implementation of this approach, we can look at the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). FedRAMP is the Federal approach to SaaS evaluation and authorization. In this case, identifying and understanding the standards is easily achieved by examination of the document used for final evaluation. There is little room for interpretation or deviation, thus providing a clear standard which must be reached, attested to, and evaluated in order to achieve certification. The standards that are attested to, then evaluated for FedRAMP certification, are those set forth by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST. By using the publicly available and clearly defined standards of NIST, the path to achieving FedRAMP is clear. While there are myriad NIST standards that must be adhered to and evaluated, the central defining standard for a SaaS IS is the Special Publication 800-53 Working from that definitive document, anyone attempting to achieve FedRAMP certification can identify exactly what is required regarding their IS. "],["atomic-mapping.html", "Chapter 3 Atomic Mapping", " Chapter 3 Atomic Mapping Once the requisite standards set by the certifying body are understood, the next step is to ensure maximum situational awareness of the entity seeking certification. In the case of FedRAMP, the provider of a SaaS Information System (IS) must be fully aware and able to describe every attribute of that IS. Some such attributes which must be attested to in documentation are: Security Technologies in use Transport Layer Security Secure Sockets Layer Encryption Methods Full Disk Encryption Tunneling Protocols Virtual Private Networks System Interconnections Platform as a Service (PaaS) Security information and event management (SIEM) While this is not an exhaustive list, the depth and breadth of the knowledge required to attest to those few lines is extensive.
