It allows two parties to objectively ensure that an agreed upon minimum standard has been met. Certification also allows a standardized method for testing of said mastery. A certification can also foster a continued relationship between entities. Given that most certifications are an inherently public endeavour, the success of the relationship can raise the perceived value of both parties. 1.1 The Short Story The three points of focus to ensure that an entity is ready to attempt a certification: Focusing on these three areas in a closed loop similar to that of the SDLC can provide an entity with the situational awareness to successfully attempt any certification or authorization with their Information System (IS). Identify and Understand the Objective Inventory and Map Document and Verify While these three focal points are broad in nature, they are sufficient to begin the process and surface deeper questions. Some of the questions that may result in bringing focus to bare here are: Do we have current documentation? Who authors and revises our documentation? What is our periodicity for revision? To whom is our documentation disseminated? What technologies or providers are we dependant on? How do we verify the efficacy of our security policies? "],["understand-the-objective.html", "Chapter 2 Understand the Objective", " Chapter 2 Understand the Objective The first step in an effort to achieve any certification is to identify and understand the standards set forth by the certifying body. That is to say, the certification itself is a result of achieving the standards. That achievement is verified by a neutral third party with testing and review. Thus, in order to be successful, it is paramount to understand what is required and how it will be verified. To illustrate the implementation of this approach, we can look at the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). FedRAMP is the Federal approach to SaaS evaluation and authorization. In this case, identifying and understanding the standards is easily achieved by examination of the document used for final evaluation. There is little room for interpretation or deviation, thus providing a clear standard which must be reached, attested to, and evaluated in order to achieve certification. The standards that are attested to, then evaluated for FedRAMP certification, are those set forth by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST. By using the publicly available and clearly defined standards of NIST, the path to achieving FedRAMP is clear. While there are myriad NIST standards that must be adhered to and evaluated, the central defining standard for a SaaS IS is the Special Publication 800-53 Working from that definitive document, anyone attempting to achieve FedRAMP certification can identify exactly what is required regarding their IS. "],["atomic-mapping.html", "Chapter 3 Atomic Mapping", " Chapter 3 Atomic Mapping Once the requisite standards set by the certifying body are understood, the next step is to ensure maximum situational awareness of the entity seeking certification. In the case of FedRAMP, the provider of a SaaS Information System (IS) must be fully aware and able to describe every attribute of that IS. Some such attributes which must be attested to in documentation are: Security Technologies in use Transport Layer Security Secure Sockets Layer Encryption Methods Full Disk Encryption Tunneling Protocols Virtual Private Networks System Interconnections Platform as a Service (PaaS) Security information and event management (SIEM) While this is not an exhaustive list, the depth and breadth of the knowledge required to attest to those few lines is extensive. "],["document-and-verify.html", "Chapter 4 Document and Verify 4.1 Documentation 4.2 Verify", " Chapter 4 Document and Verify Once the requirements of the certification are identified, and the IS is mapped, then, the next and most important step is to document the status of the IS. 4.1 Documentation The most prominant form of attestation regarding the technologies used and their implementation is a definitive document. Typically called the System Security Play (SSP), the documentation of an IS must detail every aspect within the scope of the certification. One concept used to limit the scope of documentation when attempting the FedRAMP certification is the Authorization Boundary. By articulating an Authorization Boundary, the scope of the required documentation becomes finite and specific. This is particularly important when documenting a SaaS that utilizes either an enterprise or commercial Platform as a Service (PaaS). PaaS providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure are common but by no means make up the entire field of PaaS offerings. However, they offer tremendously helpful, readily available documentation regarding what NIST 800-53 based security products, policies, and procedures they provide for their customers. Once the boundary is identified, all IS attributes that exist inside that boundary must be documented. For example, the FedRAMP SSP is broken down into 13 documents that cover the majority of system attributes within a boundary. System Security Plan (SSP) SSP ATTACHMENT 2 - User Guide SSP ATTACHMENT 3 - Digital Identity Worksheet SSP ATTACHMENT 4 - Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) SSP ATTACHMENT 4 - Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) SSP ATTACHMENT 5 - Rules of Behavior (RoB) SSP ATTACHMENT 6 - Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP) SSP ATTACHMENT 7 - Configuration Management Plan (CMP) SSP ATTACHMENT 8 - Incident Response Plan (IRP) SSP ATTACHMENT 9 - Control Implementation Summary (CIS) Workbook SSP ATTACHMENT 10 - Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 SSP ATTACHMENT 11 - Separation of Duties Matrix SSP ATTACHMENT 12 - Laws and Regulations SSP ATTACHMENT 13 - Integrated Inventory Workbook By using this model of separate specific documents that pertain to an area of the IS, FedRAMP has provided a manageable framework. Specifically each area of the IS and the pertinent documentation can be updated and revised commensurate with the need of the component itself. Thus, when the company reorganizes, the IRP can be updated without changing the Rules of Behavior. Thusly, when new legislation is introduced requiring adherence, the Laws and Regulations document can guide the requisite changes in the SSP. 4.2 Verify By endeavouring to document an IS with %100 coverage, it becomes pivotal that the documentation be reviewed and verified by more than one party. Thus, one method utilized by successful entities is to create and maintain an internal team whos mandate is to verify the veracity of any documentation used as part of the SSP.

Thus, it is incumbant upon the leadership of any team to take effective action. Such action may take the form of seeking guidence and mentorship. Or it may be identifying a resource or team that has a proven record of success in the arena you are about to enter. This is where the experience and expertise of a proven team can help provide an initial push in the right direction. Services like a Gap Analysis or an Inventory Overview are crucial ensure there are no stones left unturned. Armavel offers many services geared toward enabling Enterprise IT teams and Service Providors to successfully approach compliance and certificaiton. "]]
